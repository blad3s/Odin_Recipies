        <ul>
            <li>1 Quart Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>1 can Beef Gravy</li>
            <li>5 Medium Potatoes</li>
            <li>2 Cups Cheese Curds</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). While the oil is heating, you can begin to warm your gravy.</li>
            <li>Place the fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, about 5 minutes. Make the fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>Place the fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese over them. Ladle gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.</li>
